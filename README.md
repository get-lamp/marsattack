# MARS ATTACK - Simple shoot 'em martians up

A simple shoot 'em up I wrote a long time ago. The premise was to write a game simple enough as to be absolutely sure of 
finishing it. Here it is, so the scope was spot on :)

The was some perverse pleasure involved in abusing JS + JQuery, HTML and CSS while doing this. That was part of the
reason behind the decision. In a  more humble light, I would probably have failed to finish it, had I chosen any other 
tech.
