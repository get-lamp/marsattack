# MARS ATTACK - Dumb shoot 'em martians up

A simple shoot 'em up I wrote ages ago. The premise was to write a game simple enough as to be absolutely sure of 
finishing it. Here it is, so the scope was spot on :)

Doing it in JS + JQuery, HTML and CSS was in part a perverse decision that seemed funny to me at that time. But in a 
more humble light, I would probably have failed to finish it, had I chosen any other tech.
